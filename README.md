# Calculator functions

The calculator performs seven types of operations: add( + ), subtract( - ), divide( / ), multiply( * ), reset values ("C"), power(x^y) and squared root ( √ ).

To perform the operations you need to insert two into "Element 1" and "Element 2" by keyboard or up/down buttons and then, you should select the type. However, the squared root is a special case because only needs "Element 1". Finally, the result is displayed on the screen.
